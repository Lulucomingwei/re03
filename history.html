    <h3 class="title">History of the Silk Road</h3>
    <p>The history of the Silk Road dates back to the 2nd century BC. Here is a detailed historical record. </p>
    <div class="item">
      <ul>
        <li>Western Han Dynasty: From about 202 BC to 8 AD, Emperor Wudi of Han sent Zhang Qian to the Western Regions,
          officially opening up the overland Silk Road. Starting from the capital Chang 'an (today's Xi 'an), the road
          went through Gansu and Xinjiang, connecting Central and Western Asia and eventually reaching Europe.</li>
        <li>Eastern Han Dynasty: From 25 to 220 AD, Ban Chao operated the Western Regions, further extending and
          expanding
          the Silk Road.</li>
        <li>Tang Dynasty: From AD 618-907, the Silk Road reached its peak and became an important channel for economic
          and
          cultural exchanges between the East and the West.</li>
        <li>Song and Yuan Dynasties: From 960 to 1368, the Maritime Silk Road gradually emerged, complementing the land
          Silk Road.</li>
        <li>Ming and Qing Dynasties: 1368-1912, the Silk Road gradually declined, but still maintained trade to a
          certain
          extent.</li>
        <li>20th century: Around 1900, the German geographer Richthofen first used the name "Silk Road".</li>
        <li>20th century: In 2013, Chinese leaders put forward the initiative of jointly building the Silk Road Economic
          Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="item">
      <p>The Silk Road was an important trade route connecting China and the West in ancient times, which had a profound
        impact on the historical development of China and the world. It not only promoted trade between the East and the
        West, but also spread exchanges in religion, culture, science and technology. Today, the Belt and Road
        Initiative aims to inherit and carry forward the spirit of the Silk Road and strengthen cooperation and
        exchanges between countries.</p>

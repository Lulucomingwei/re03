      <p>The history of the "Maritime Silk Road" can be traced back to the Western Han Dynasty in the 2nd century BC,
        developed in the Wei and Jin dynasties, gradually flourished in the Sui and Tang Dynasties, reached its peak in
        the Song and Yuan Dynasties, and gradually declined in the late 16th century and Ming Dynasty due to the opening
        of new Western shipping routes and the implementation of the "sea ban policy". In modern times, China lost its
        sea power, became a semi-colony of Western powers, and its coastal ports were forced to open, becoming a market
        for Western dumped goods. This situation continued throughout the Republic of China until the eve of the
        founding of New China.</p>

      <p>In 2013, China proposed to build the "21st Century Maritime Silk Road" and made it a national strategy, giving
        new vitality to the Maritime Silk Road. In general, the Maritime Silk Road was located in Quanzhou City, Fujian
        Province, China, mainly centered on the South China Sea. The specific route was: from the coastal ports of
        Guangdong and Fujian, through the South China Sea, Persian Gulf and Red Sea, silk, ceramics, spices, tea and
        other products produced in China were transported to Europe and other countries in Asia and Africa, while
        European merchants brought woolen goods and ivory to China through this road.</p>
